### ***Problem Statement***


- An analysis of paleo-present climate data

- Analyse CO2 vs Temperature Anomaly from 800kyrs â€“ present.

- Examine one other (paleo/modern) features (e.g. CH4 or polar ice-coverage)

- Examine Irish context:

- Climate change signals: (see Maynooth study: The emergence of a climate change signal in long-term Irish meteorological observations - ScienceDirect) <br>

- Fuse and analyse data from various data sources and format fused data set as a pandas dataframe and export to csv and json formats <br>

- For all of the above variables, analyse the data, the trends and the relationships between them (temporal leads/lags/frequency analysis). <br>

- Predict global temperature anomaly over next few decades (synthesise data) and compare to published climate models if atmospheric CO2 trends continue <br>

- Comment on accelerated warming based on very latest features (e.g. temperature/polar-ice-coverage)<br>
