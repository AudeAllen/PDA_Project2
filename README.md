1 Introduction project
======
### ***Problem Statement***


- An analysis of paleo-present climate data

- Analyse CO2 vs Temperature Anomaly from 800kyrs â€“ present.

- Examine one other (paleo/modern) features (e.g. CH4 or polar ice-coverage)

- Examine Irish context:

- Climate change signals: (see Maynooth study: The emergence of a climate change signal in long-term Irish meteorological observations - ScienceDirect) <br>

- Fuse and analyse data from various data sources and format fused data set as a pandas dataframe and export to csv and json formats <br>

- For all of the above variables, analyse the data, the trends and the relationships between them (temporal leads/lags/frequency analysis). <br>

- Predict global temperature anomaly over next few decades (synthesise data) and compare to published climate models if atmospheric CO2 trends continue <br>

- Comment on accelerated warming based on very latest features (e.g. temperature/polar-ice-coverage)<br>

2 Software needed to run the project
======

Please see below for the different tools and packages that I am using for the tasks and anslyses.

Download Anaconda - Anaconda is a package that aims to simplify package management
- scikit learn
- pandas
- numpy

- Download Visual Studio Code

- Jupyer Notebook

- Download Github - https://github.com/AudeAllen/PDA_Project2.git

To run the tasks simply click on 'Run all' for PDA_Project2.ipynb. The project is a mix of code and markdown blocks which explain each part of each task. You can perform this action either in Visual Studio code or in Anconda in Jupyer Notebook.

3 Analyse CO2 vs Temperature from 800kyrs
======

This section contains analysis of both CO2 and temperature data from the ice cores dating back 800K years ago. I have also amalgamated more recent data from other sources such as Mauna Loa data.

This section contains a roughwork section.

4 Analyse CH4 vs Temperature from 800kyrs
======

This section contains analysis of both CO4 and temperature data from the ice cores dating back 800K years ago. I have also amalgamated more recent data from other sources such as Mauna Loa data.

I have included a roughwork section in this part of the project also.

5 Analyse Irish Context
======

In this section of my project I have completed analysis of Irelands temperature anomoly from the early 1900's to the present day. I have looked at lead, lag features during this analysis as well as frequency analysis

6 Predict Global Temperature Anomoly
======

In this section I will predict global temperature anomaly over next few decades by performing regression analysis on the temperature anomoly data. This data spans a number of decades from 1850 to 2023.
